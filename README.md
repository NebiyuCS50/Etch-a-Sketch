# Etch-a-Sketch

An interactive Etch-a-Sketch web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can draw by hovering over a dynamic grid of squares, which change color as the mouse passes over them. The grid size can be resized with a button click.

## Features

- Hover-based drawing on a grid
- Button to resize the grid dynamically
- Color change effect on mouseenter and mouseleave
- Responsive layout using CSS Flexbox
- Clean and minimal interface

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## How It Works

- By default, a 16x16 grid is generated.
- Hovering over a square changes its color.
- Clicking the Resize button prompts the user to enter a new grid size (up to 100), which then updates the board.
